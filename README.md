## Making Sure My Code Works and Is Secure

To keep my code functional and secure, I rely on testing and sticking to good practices. Unit testing is my first stop. It’s a great way to check that each piece of the program does what it’s supposed to. For example, in the contact service, I made sure things like having a unique contact ID and rejecting invalid inputs worked perfectly by writing JUnit tests. On the security side, it's important to validate inputs and handle exceptions the right way to prevent issues. Tools like static code analyzers and getting a second pair of eyes during code reviews also help me catch problems early and make the code stronger.

## Figuring Out What Users Need

Understanding what users actually want starts with listening and breaking down their requests into smaller, doable tasks. Once I know what’s important to them, I make sure the program delivers exactly that. For instance, in the contact service, one key need was to have unique IDs for each contact, so I made sure my tests and code nailed that. I also stay open to feedback so I can tweak things and make sure the program really works for the people using it.

## How I Design Software

When I’m designing software, I like to start by mapping things out, whether it’s with diagrams or just sketching ideas. This helps me figure out how the pieces will fit together and spot potential issues before they happen. I break things into smaller chunks and focus on making them reusable and easy to test. My approach is all about keeping it simple, flexible, and ready for changes if needed.

## Wrapping It Up

Looking back at these projects, I’ve learned how important it is to stay focused on the user, build secure code, and keep things organized. Taking the time to test, plan, and really think through the design not only makes the project better but also makes my life easier down the road.
